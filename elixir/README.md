# Advent of Code 2021

Well, I finally started to solve some exercises on Hackerrank.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `advent` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:advent, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
